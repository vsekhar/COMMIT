# COMMIT

COMMIT is a proof-of-concept stack of services and protocols for verifiable decentralized action on the web.

It consists of the following components:

 * Notary: a trust-nothing verifiable notary and timestamping service
 * Button: a timed atomic decision primitive
 * Consensus: a consensus protocol for multiple parties to agree on some action
